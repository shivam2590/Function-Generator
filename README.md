# Function-Generator
This project is completely based on Simulation. I have used the LTspice tool to design this circuit of the function generator. This Function Generator Generates three basic signal, Sin Wave, Square wave and Triangle wave. The Variable frequency can go up to 500 KHz. This is due to slew rate, CMRR and Bandwidth Product of OP Amp.
